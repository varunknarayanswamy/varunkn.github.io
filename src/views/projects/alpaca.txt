The Alpaca project, previously known as The Wearable Toolkit, is a mobile applicaton project I developed at the Atlas Institute's Laboratory for Playful Computation at CU Boulder.
The project hopes to teach the next generation about the world of machine learning through the lense of improving physical fitness and training sports skills - such as a baseball pitch.*

The application connects through bluetooth to a accelerometer and gryoscope wearable device. 
When the user decide to train the action in mind, they simply record a video of themselves performing it. As the video is recorded, the application simultaneously records accelerometer data in the x-y-z directions for the duration of the video. 
The application then graphs the data out for the user and, using a dynamic time warping algorithm, categories the action as proper or improper form.
The user can then determine if the algorithm's decision is correct, giving it more data to train off of in future iterations. *

The application works to become a sort of sports trainer in any activity, correcting the users form over time to help them perfect their technique. 
However initially, it itself is instead trained by the user, giving the user an experience with training a machine learning model. 
In other words, the user first trains the user on what the correct action is, and afterward the application will continue to inform users on the state of their action.
The application can give a new understand to the processes involved in machine learning while also help improve sports form and technique over time.
