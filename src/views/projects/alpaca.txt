The alpaca project, previously known as the wearable toolkit is a mobile applicaton project I helped developed in the Labaratory for Playful Computation.
The project hopes to teach the youth about the world of machine learning through the lense of improving physical fitness and training sports skills.*

The application connects through bluetooth to a accelerometer and gryoscope arduino board. 
When the user decide to try the action in mind, they record a video while simulationously record accelerometer data in the x y z direction. 
The application then graphs the data out for the user and using a dynamic time warping algorithm categories the action as good or bad. 
The user can then determine if the algorithms decision is correct giving it more data to train off of for future swings*

The application works to be sports trainer in any activity, correcting the users form over time to help them perfect their technique. 
But initially, it itself is instead trained by the user, giving the user an experience with training a machine learning model. 
The application can give a new understand to the processes involved in machine learning while also help improve sports form and technique over time.
