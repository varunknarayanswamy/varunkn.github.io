The Internet Accessibility Map is a H3 project built in ObservableHQ. This project is an data visualization project which illustrates who the increase in internet access and usage in households affects the gender ratio of men to women using the internet.*

This project uses the data collected by Meta on the last 5 years of internet usage around the world. This project focuses only on 3 of those years from 2018 to 2020 as we do not have required information for 2017 and 2021. The data is mapped to a color value which determines the brightness of the individual country on the map.*

For the first map, which maps the percent of the household which uses the internet, the brighter the country indicates a higher percentage, and more internet usage. For the second map, which maps the percent difference between male and female internet usage, the brighter the color the larger the differences, indicating more male usage*

Based on the data visualization, it is clear that over the last few years the percentage of internet users in the household especially in developing countries has increased, and with that, the percentage of men to woman has decreased. This indicates that more woman have been exposed to the internet, balancing the ratio.*
