The fractal project is a musical data visualization project developed for a Markov Chain Project. *

This group project takes in a song and depending on a number of different aspects such as current volume, frequency, and rythme. This can make an impact on the size of the fractal, the width, height and the colors. *

The project was developed in Processing, using Java and Python. This application uses the Fast Fourier Transformation Matrix to analyzing an MP3 of music, and uses it build fractal trees with a variety of different design determined by the sound waves the matrix interprets.
