Nothing bothers me more than when someone gives me a restaurant suggestion that sounds interesting but when I need it I can't remember it. *

Munchmaps is an iOS mobile application that allows users to search for a filtered set of restaurants based on price, cuisine and more. 
Once discovered they can then save the restaurants as Saved or Future restaurants. *

Below is a short video demo of how Munchmaps works in action running on a real phone *

Munchmaps is developed in Swift and uses the Zomato API to display the needed restaurants in the local area. 
It displays a map indicator of where the restaurant is and allows users to see a quick list of all saved and future restaurants.*
