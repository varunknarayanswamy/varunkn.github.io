Nothing bothers me more than when someone gives me a restaurant suggestion that sounds interesting... but when I need it I can't remember it. *

Munchmaps is an iOS mobile application that allows users to search for a filtered set of restaurants based on price, cuisine and more. 
Once discovered they can then save the restaurants as Saved or Future restaurants in order to keep track of them in the future. *

Below is a short video demo of how Munchmaps works in action running on a real phone *

Munchmaps is developed in Swift and uses the Zomato API to display the filtered restaurants in the local area. 
It displays a map indicator of where the restaurant is and allows users to see a quick list of all of their saved and future restaurants.*
