The Internet Accessibility Map is a D3 project built in ObservableHQ. This project is an data visualization project which illustrates the change around the world in number of internet users per households and the ratio of men to women using the internet.*

This project uses the data collected by Meta over the last 5 years on the internet usage around the world. The data is mapped to a color value which is presented on the individual country on the map.*

For the first map, which maps the percent of internet users in the household, the brighter the country indicates a higher percentage, and more internet usage. For the second map, which maps the percent difference between male and female internet usage, the brighter the color the larger the differences, indicating more male usage to female usage.*

Based on the data visualization, it seems that over the last few years the percentage of internet users in the household, especially in developing countries, has increased, and with that, the percentage of men to woman has decreased. This indicates that more woman have been exposed to the internet, balancing the ratio in these said countries.*
